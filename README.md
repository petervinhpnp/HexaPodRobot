Hey everyone, if you are seeing this message then thank you for spending time reading this Hexapod Robot project of mine and the team in 1 of the courses at RMIT university. You probably wonder why would I post a project from course to Github, well, simply is that because I spent lots of time in creating and modifying this robot so I gained quite mechanically assembly and electrical system (embedded systgem). I really don't know what to describe the project rather than let you freely explore and modify with your imagination. That what makes thing become real cool. Enjoy! :D
